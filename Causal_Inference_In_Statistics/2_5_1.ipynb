    "a) We first list the v-structures in the graph. Equivalent graphs must also only have these v-structures.\n",

    "$W \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z_{3}$<br>\n",
    "$W \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z_{2}$<br>\n",
    "$Z_{1} \\rightarrow Z_{3} \\leftarrow Z_{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves the following arrows that could be changed.\n",

    "$Z_{1} \\rightarrow X$<br>\n",
    "$Z_{3} \\rightarrow X$<br>\n",
    "$X \\rightarrow W$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Flipping $X \\rightarrow W$ would introduce a new v-structure ($W \\rightarrow X \\leftarrow Z_{3}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flipping $Z_{1} \\rightarrow X$ would introduce a cycle ($X \\rightarrow Z_{1} \\rightarrow Z_{3} \\rightarrow X$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flipping $Z_{3} \\rightarrow X$ would also introduce a new v-structure ($X \\rightarrow Z_{3} \\leftarrow Z_{2}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, no arrows can be reversed in the model to create an equivalent model.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Since the equivalence class only contains one graph, there is only one observationally equivalent graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) If we assume that for each test of directionality for a given arrow, we already know the directionality of all other arrows (the question isn't clear), then for each arrow we can look for an independence that exists for one direction of the arrow but does not for the opposite direction. Here we use $A \\perp B \\mid C$ to mean $A$ is independent to $B$ given $C$.\n",

    "\n",
    "d) From the graph we know that $Y \\perp X \\mid W, Z_{1}, Z_{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the regression $y = r_{x}x + r_{w}w + r_{1}z_{1} + r_{3}z_{3}$, this implies that $r_{x}$ should be zero. If it isn't, then the model is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) From the graph we know that $Z_{3} \\perp W \\mid X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the regression $z_{3} = r_{x}x + r_{w}w$, this implies that $r_{w}$ should be zero. If it isn't, then the model is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Without $X$ we cannot build an expression for $Z_{3}$ because $W$ is the only variable that isn't adjacent to $Z_{3}$ and $X$ is the only variable that d-separates the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "g) For each pair of non-adjacent variables we can find the d-separating sets and use these to build our regression equations to test.\n",
